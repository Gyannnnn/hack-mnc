### The Interview Experience

To be honest, I was **very nervous** in the beginning. But the interviewers were **extremely friendly and welcoming** — there was **one sir** who focused on the **technical part** and **one ma’am** who handled the **HR and behavioral aspects**.

They started with a few general questions to make me comfortable, and that really helped calm my nerves. Throughout the conversation, they were **polite**, **encouraging**, and made the entire experience feel more like a discussion than a test.

I managed to answer **most of the questions**, and whenever I wasn’t completely sure about something, I handled it by saying things like:

> “For now, I know this much about it,”
> 
> 
> or, “I’d like to skip this part for now.”
> 

During the **coding section**, I explained my thought process clearly and wrote **pseudo code snippets** instead of diving directly into syntax. I made sure they understood my logic and approach.

Whenever I went silent or looked too tense, they actually comforted me — they even asked me about my day just to ease the atmosphere. That small gesture made a huge difference!

I tried to answer everything with **honesty and politeness**, and at the end, they told me not to stress too much — that I did well and should be more confident next time.

### Technical Questions

Here are some of the **technical topics and questions** I was asked during the interview:

- **OOP Concepts** — especially the **four pillars of OOP**
- **Python Programming** basics
- **While and Do-While Loops**
- **Number Series Logic**
- **Coding Question:** Reverse a string

---

### Domain-Specific Questions (Machine Learning)

Since my resume was focused on the **Machine Learning domain**, many of the questions were based on that area:

- Difference between **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**
- Concepts of **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**
- **Regression vs Classification**
- What is a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **ANN vs CNN**

---

### Puzzle Question

They also asked a fun **logical puzzle**:

> Arrange the numbers 1 to 9 in a 3×3 matrix so that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is equal.
> 

It was interesting and tested logical thinking more than technical skill.

### HR Questions

Toward the end, there were a few general and reflective questions such as:

- “Where do you see yourself in the next 2–3 years?”
- “Which domain or specific area do you want to explore more?”

I answered them honestly, focusing on my interest in learning and growing in the tech field.

### My Takeaway

The entire interview was a **great learning experience**. It taught me that being nervous is completely okay — what matters is how you handle it. Honesty, calmness, and clear communication make a big difference.

> My advice to everyone preparing: Stay confident, don’t fear what you don’t know, and always explain your thought process. The interviewers appreciate effort and clarity more than perfection.

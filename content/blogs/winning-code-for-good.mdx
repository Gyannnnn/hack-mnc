The Code for Good hackathon is the part of hiring process of JP Morgan Chase & Co. The selection process was highly competitive, featuring two rounds:-

- Round 1: Coding assessment- 2 DSA questions were given to be solved within an hour.
- Round 2: HireVue interview round- 2 questions were asked focusing on behavioural skills.

After getting selected among 50000+ students, I got the opportunity to showcase my skills to solve real world problems. I was shortlisted in Batch-1 for Mumbai location dated 7th June to 8th June 2025. 

## The Problem Statement

The hackathon began with the problem statement selection round where the NGO partners discussed the problem statements with the participants. After the discussion, we needed to submit the preference order and luckily my team got the first choice- Shatam Care Foundation.

**Objective:-** As Shatam Care Foundation is involved in matchmaking careseekers and caregivers, they wanted to automate the process by helping them digitalize it.

## The Solution

We developed a website designed to facilitate and manage this matchmaking process with key features including:-

- Automated matchmaking between careseekers and caregivers (whom we proudly call sarthi)
- B2B and B2G collaboration modules
- Training of individuals to become caregivers
- Admin monitoring dashboard
- Two-way feedback mechanism
- Multilingual support
- WhatsApp integration for low-connectivity regions
- Voice assistance feature

### The Team

I had the privilege of working with an amazing team — Mugdhi Saxena, Devansh Paliwal, Shiva Balaji Kontham, Shivam Kapoor, Vishwash Bharti and Saheli Deb — and we were guided by our incredible mentors Akshay Khandekar, Disha Chheda and Bishwa Ranjan Sarkar, whose insights kept us focused throughout the day-long hackathon.

From brainstorming ideas to coding through the night, every moment at Code For Good was packed with learning, laughter and teamwork. Although I was not able to grab the full-time position offer at JP Morgan Chase, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute towards solving real-world social challenges while learning, growing and building lifelong memories.

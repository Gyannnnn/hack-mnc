## Round 1 – Technical Interview

The first round was completely technical and focused mainly on my **resume, projects, and internships**. The interviewer asked detailed questions about my projects — what they do, what makes them unique, and the technologies I used. I was also asked a **simple DSA question** based on arrays. Since the problem was easy, I shared **two to three possible approaches**, coded the solution quickly, and also explained the **time complexities** for each approach. The interviewer seemed satisfied with the structured way I explained my thought process.

## Round 2 – Technical + HR

The second round was a mix of technical and HR questions. Due to a brief network issue, I joined the meeting a minute late, which initially made me nervous. However, the interviewer was extremely polite and helped me feel comfortable. The discussion started with introductions, followed by questions from **core computer fundamentals** like the difference between `private`, `public`, and `protected`. Once again, I was given a **simple DSA problem** to solve, where I had to **write the code in the chat box** itself (no need to run it). Again here I gave 2 approaches and coded them up.

The interviewer then mentioned that *UBS doesn’t just look for talent, but for sharpness*, and asked me a **puzzle** to test my logical thinking. 

- “A father and his son met with an accident, and both were taken to a hospital. The boy was badly injured, and as he was taken into the operation theatre, the doctor said — *‘I can’t operate on this boy, he’s my son.’* How is that possible?”

Toward the end, there were a few **situational HR questions**, and I got a chance to ask her one question as well — which turned into a 10-minute discussion. I would definitely recommend **asking at least one question to the interviewer**; it helps create a good impression and makes the conversation more engaging.

## Round 3 – HR Interview

The final round was purely HR-based and lasted around **10 minutes**. The interviewer asked about my **family background**, **why I wanted to join UBS**, and whether I was **willing to relocate**. It was a very short and relaxed interaction.

The **next day, July 19th**, the results were announced, and I was thrilled to know that I had been **selected**.

## Key Takeaways

- **Be thorough with your resume.** Most technical questions are directly picked from your projects or internships, so know what you did, how you did it, and why.
- **You can drive the interview with your answers.** The way you explain something often decides what the next question will be — so highlight topics you’re confident about and gently steer the discussion in that direction.
- **Communication matters as much as knowledge.** Even simple questions can make a strong impression if answered clearly and confidently.
- **Ask at least one question to the interviewer.** It shows curiosity and can turn into a meaningful conversation.
- **Clarity, confidence, and composure** together create a lasting impression — even more than perfectly solving every question.

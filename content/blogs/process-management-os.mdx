# Introduction to Process Management

In an operating system, a **process** is a program in execution. It is more than just the program code; it includes the current activity, as represented by the value of the program counter and the contents of the processor's registers.

## Process Lifecycle

A process goes through various states during its lifecycle:

1.  **New**: The process is being created.
2.  **Running**: Instructions are being executed.
3.  **Waiting**: The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal).
4.  **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
5.  **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

## Process Control Block (PCB)

Each process is represented in the operating system by a Process Control Block (PCB) - also called a Task Control Block. It contains many pieces of information associated with a specific process:

-   Process state
-   Program counter
-   CPU registers
-   CPU scheduling information
-   Memory-management information
-   Accounting information
-   I/O status information

```c
struct task_struct {
    volatile long state;    /* -1 unrunnable, 0 runnable, >0 stopped */
    void *stack;
    atomic_t usage;
    unsigned int flags;     /* per process flags, defined below */
    unsigned int ptrace;
    
    int lock_depth;         /* BKL lock depth */
    
    // ... many more fields
};
```

## Scheduling Algorithms

Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating system. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

### First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

-   **Description**: The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.
-   **Pros**: Simple to understand and implement.
-   **Cons**: Convoy effect (short process behind long process).

### Shortest Job Next (SJN)

-   **Description**: Associate with each process the length of its next CPU burst. Use these lengths to schedule the process with the shortest time.
-   **Pros**: Minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes.
-   **Cons**: Diffcult to know the length of the next CPU request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modern operating systems use complex combinations of these algorithms, often prioritizing interactive processes to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion

Understanding process management is crucial for grasping how operating systems manage resources and execute programs efficiently. It forms the backbone of multitasking environments.

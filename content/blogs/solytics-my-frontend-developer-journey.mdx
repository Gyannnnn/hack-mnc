## The Selection Process

The hiring process at Solytics Partners had multiple stages, each designed to test both **technical skills** and **problem-solving ability**.

It began with a **technical assessment** of around **20–30 questions** covering **core computer science fundamentals** like data structures, algorithms, and basic programming logic.

After clearing that, I went through **two technical interview rounds**:

**Round 1:**

This round focused mainly on **core JavaScript**, the **internal architecture of React**, and building small UI components.I was asked to create a **dropdown menu** that displays a list of items — simple, but it tested my understanding of logic and reusability.

**Round 2:**

The second round was a bit more challenging. The questions were based on **service workers**, **threads**, **arrays**, **linked lists**, and **Git basics**.I was also given a **practical task** — to build a **Money Box App using only JavaScript**, where the user could add money, buy an item, and see the remaining balance after purchase.It really tested my ability to think logically and write clean, functional code.

Finally, there was an **HR round**, where we talked about my **future goals**, communication skills, and overall fit for the team. It was quite conversational and comfortable.

## Resources That Helped Me

Here are a few resources that really helped me in my preparation journey:

**JavaScript & Frontend Development**

[Chai aur Code (Hitesh Choudhary)](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode)

**CS Fundamentals (DSA, OS, DBMS)**

[FreeCodeCamp YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)

Apart from these, I strongly suggest practicing regularly and **learning to write code without relying on AI tools**. It improves your problem-solving mindset and helps you understand the logic behind every line of code.

## 💬 My Final Note

If you’re preparing for placements, focus on **building strong fundamentals** and **writing clean, logical code**. Practice daily, stay consistent, and don’t be afraid to build small projects they teach you more than theory ever can.

## Online Assessment

The process began with a coding and technical assessment, which included a mix of coding questions and core Computer Science subjects such as Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Database Management Systems (DBMS), Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), and Computer Networks (CN).

Following that, there was a behavioural and cognitive assessment designed to evaluate logical reasoning, situational judgement, and personality alignment with UBS’s work culture. This round also included a few IQ-based follow-up questions, making it both challenging and interesting.

I performed well in both segments and was shortlisted for the interview rounds, which marked the next and most crucial stage of the process.

## Interview Rounds

My interviews were scheduled toward the end of the day, so I had to wait quite a while before my turn. UBS conducted three interviews in total, each with different interviewers : two technical rounds followed by one HR round.

## Technical Round 1: Core CS Fundamentals

The first technical interview was conducted by a senior IT professional from UBS. After a brief self-introduction, he began asking questions that revolved around the core computer science concepts covering DSA, DBMS, CN, OOPs, and basic system design.

The discussion included both theoretical questions and real-life application scenarios, where I had to explain how I would apply certain concepts to solve practical problems. The interviewer maintained a professional tone and seemed focused on testing my clarity of fundamentals and problem-solving approach.

## Technical Round 2: Project-Centric Discussion

The second interview was much more project-oriented. The interviewer carefully reviewed my resume and asked detailed questions about the projects I had built  particularly about their **purpose, tech stack, and real-world impact**.

We had an in-depth conversation about the architecture and implementation of each project. This round made me realise the importance of having **thorough knowledge** of your own projects, even if some parts were built using references or external help.

The interviewer appreciated my structured explanations and my understanding of how each component contributed to solving real problems.

## HR Round: Personality & Fit

The final round was a Human Resources interview, conducted by a senior HR professional at UBS. It was a much lighter and conversational session compared to the technical ones.

She asked general questions such as:

What are your strengths and weaknesses?

Where do you see yourself in the next few years with UBS?

Are you open to relocation?

Tell me about your previous internship experiences.

By this point, I felt confident and comfortable, sensing that I had performed well across all rounds.

## Key Takeaways

The UBS selection process was a great learning experience. It tested not just my technical expertise but also my composure, adaptability, and self-awareness. Here are my biggest lessons from the journey:

**Be confident and authentic**. Don’t copy someone else’s introduction or style reflect your own identity.

It’s okay to not know everything. I could only answer around **60–70%** of the technical questions, but honesty and calmness mattered more than perfection.

**Avoid bluffing**. If you don’t know an answer, say so  it shows integrity and self-awareness.

**Be a balanced learner**. You don’t need to be a master of one area; being a jack of all trades can be more valuable. Maintain a good balance across projects, academics, and communication skills.

Gain experience wherever you can. Whether it’s a low or zero-stipend internship, hands-on learning will always outweigh grades or theoretical knowledge.

## Final Thoughts

The UBS interview experience was both insightful and rewarding. Each round taught me something new about communication, preparation, and mindset. The biggest takeaway was that confidence, honesty, and consistency are what truly set you apart.

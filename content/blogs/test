summary: This is the raw, unfiltered story of how a normal, confused student discovered discipline, clarity, and confidence — and eventually became an AIR Topper. Not a story of marks, but of mindset and transformation.

# 

This is not a story about marks.

Not about rank.

Not about “success.”

This is a story about a boy who had no idea where life was taking him…

until one exam, one decision, one journey changed everything.

If you’re my junior, imagine I’m sitting next to you —

speaking honestly, without filters, without ego.

Because seniors rarely tell the truth.

But I will.

## 🌱 **How It Really Started**

When I entered college, I didn’t even know what GATE truly meant.

But I knew one thing:

I loved solving problems.

That curiosity pushed me into **Competitive Programming (CP) in my first year.**

No pressure.

No guidance.

Just pure **love for logic.**

In second year, life was noisy — fests, clubs, internships, everyone figuring out their future.

Somewhere in that noise, one thought whispered:

**“Why not try GATE?”**

So I decided…

**CP + GATE.** Side by side.

Without knowing this decision would shape my entire life.

## ⚡ **The Combo No One Talks About: CP + GATE**

People keep **comparing CP and GATE** as if they’re enemies.

For me?

They were my strongest teammates.

**CP →** made C, DSA, and Algorithms feel effortless.

**GATE →** gave deep theory, discipline, clarity.

CP taught speed.

GATE taught stability.

Without **CP,** concepts felt incomplete.

Without **GATE,** depth felt missing.

**Together?
Magic.**

## 🧠 **Let Me Be Completely Honest**

I wasn’t a born genius.

I wasn’t school topper.

I wasn’t someone who “gets everything in one shot.”

I had weaknesses:

– I forgot theory fast

– COA felt alien

– TOC scared me

– Aptitude confused me

– I got distracted easily

– Long study hours drained me

But I had one superpower:

**I didn’t pretend to be smart.**

I accepted my weaknesses.

And I worked on them — slowly, consistently, honestly.

That humility… saved me.

## 📚 **How I Actually Studied (Real Version, Not Instagram Version)**

No 12-hour study days.

No overnight heroics.

Just a simple loop:

- 1 hour concepts

• 1 hour CP

• 30–40 mins revision

• 1 hour PYQs

• Break

• Repeat

Small sessions.

High retention.

No burnout.

And revision?

Unbelievable amounts of revision.

I revised till:

– COA pipelines felt predictable

– TOC automata felt intuitive

– DBMS schedules felt natural

Mocks were my brutal mirror.

Not to prove I’m good.

But to understand why I wasn’t.

And slowly — mistakes fell, confidence rose.

## 🌙 **My Life Looked Very Different During Preparation**

While others chilled at night,

I coded.

While people went for dinner,

I solved PYQs.

While friends slept,

I watched revision lectures.

While relatives visited,

I revised COA.

Not because I wanted to be special.

Because I believed…

**“One day, all of this will pay off.”**

## 🧘‍♂️ **Exam Day — The Moment That Changed My Mindset**

Outside the center, I saw two kinds of people:

1️⃣ Those acting overly confident

2️⃣ Those secretly shivering inside

A few minutes before the exam, the same “toppers” stood outside with shaky hands, flipping last-minute notes in panic.

And it hit me:

**If fear enters the exam hall before you do…
you’ve already lost.**

I stayed calm.

I told myself:

Some questions will shock me.

Some will drain me.

Some will test me.

But I know how to think.

How to break a problem.

How to stay composed.

That mindset changed the whole exam.

## 🎯 **Inside the Exam Hall**

I didn’t chase marks.

I didn’t race.

I solved one question at a time.

Skipped ruthlessly.

Came back calmly.

CP brain + GATE discipline = **pure stability.**

When I hit Submit, I genuinely had no idea of my result.

But I had peace.

Because I gave everything I had.

And that was enough.

## 📅 **Result Day — Everything Shifted**

Messages poured in.

Teachers appreciated.

Friends celebrated.

Family was emotional.

But something else felt even bigger.

## 🌟 **The PW Felicitation Event — A Moment I’ll Never Forget**

This… felt unreal.

I met the legends I studied from.

The teachers who shaped millions of lives.

Then…

I met **Alakh Sir.**

My role model.

My inspiration.

A man whose presence alone carries impact.

Talking to him…

shaking hands…

felt like a lifetime moment.

Then I met **Viswadeep Sir.**

The **COA & OS** king.

The energy he carries is fire.

Standing beside him felt like standing next to a superhero.

Those moments weren’t rewards.

They were reminders of what hard work creates.

## 💫 **How My Life Changed After That**

![c7a707dc-6adc-44c1-bbbb-e91b820f2275.jpg](My%20GATE%20Journey%20%E2%80%94%20The%20One%20Story%20I%20Wish%20Every%20Junio/c7a707dc-6adc-44c1-bbbb-e91b820f2275.jpg)

Not because of rank.

But because of the transformation inside me.

My confidence grew.

My mindset matured.

Opportunities opened.

People noticed.

Students reached out.

Purpose became clearer.

I wasn’t just preparing for an exam anymore.

I was preparing for life.

---

## 💛 **If You’re My Junior, Read This Twice**

Start early.

Don’t run from tough subjects.

**CP + GATE is powerful.**

Don’t get fooled by loud confidence.

Revision is everything.

Mocks teach you more than teachers.

Consistency beats talent.

Believe in yourself.

Especially when no one else does.

If someone like me —

a normal guy with normal abilities —

can reach here,

you can go even further.

**Your journey is waiting.
Start writing it today.**

Securing a Full-Time Offer from Incture Technologies stands as one of the most significant milestones in my career journey. It was an on-campus placement opportunity at my university- VSSUT, Burla.

The selection process was both challenging and rewarding, designed to test problem-solving depth, system design thinking and overall professional readiness. It consisted of three rounds:-

## 1. Coding Assessment

The first round tested problem-solving abilities through three coding questions that covered areas like string manipulation, mathematical logic and array-based reasoning. The time limit to solve all 3 of them was only 1 hour.

## 2. Design Round

The second round resembled a mini System Design challenge. Out of two given problem statements, we had to choose one, understand the underlying requirements and propose a detailed solution architecture. I focused on designing a scalable and innovative solution, emphasizing data flow, component interaction and uniqueness of my solution. Roughly the first problem statement revolved around developing a social community app to help people of a certain society, and the second revolved around developing a payment app like Paytm but better (innovative).

## 3. Final Interview

The final round was an hour-long personal interview focusing on both technical and behavioural skills. It began with a brief introduction of myself, followed by an in-depth walkthrough of my resume. The discussion carried on about my skills and how I used them in my projects. The interviewers revisited my design round solution asking about design choices, authorisation and performance considerations, and improvement possibilities. They also touched upon the analytical and behavioural aspects asking about learning paths and scenario-based questions, especially asking about using technology to solve real-world problems. The round truly tested not just what I knew, but how I think, communicate and collaborate in a professional setting.

When the final results were announced and I saw my name on the selection list, it was a moment filled with pride, relief and gratitude. The entire process not only validated my skills but also inspired me to continue learning, growing and contributing meaningfully to real-world solutions.     similarly give a catch title and description for blog

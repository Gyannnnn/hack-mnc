## Your Complete Resource for Meta Coding Interviews

Preparing for a Meta (formerly Facebook) coding interview requires strategic practice with the right problems. This comprehensive guide covers 563+ LeetCode questions that have been asked at Meta, complete with frequency data, difficulty levels, topic categorization, and cross-company insights to help you ace your interview.

Whether you're preparing for an E3 new grad position, E4 software engineer role, or even an internship, this resource provides everything you need to succeed in Meta's rigorous technical interviews.

## What to Expect in a Meta Coding Interview

Meta's technical interviews are known for their focus on problem-solving abilities, code quality, and communication skills. The typical Meta coding interview consists of:

- **2-3 coding rounds** during the onsite (or virtual onsite)
- **45-60 minutes per session** with one or two problems
- **Medium to Hard difficulty** problems from LeetCode
- **Strong emphasis on optimization** and discussing time/space complexity
- **Behavioral components** integrated with technical evaluation

Meta interviewers evaluate not just your ability to solve problems, but how you think through edge cases, optimize solutions, and communicate your approach clearly.

Based on recent interview data from the last 6 months, here are the patterns emerging in Meta interviews:

### Top Problem Categories by Frequency:
1. **Arrays and Strings** (35% of questions)
2. **Trees and Graphs** (25% of questions)
3. **Dynamic Programming** (15% of questions)
4. **Hash Tables and Maps** (12% of questions)
5. **Linked Lists** (8% of questions)

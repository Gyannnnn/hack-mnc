1. State current complexity: "This solution is O(n²) time, O(1) space"
2. Identify bottleneck: "The nested loop is the issue"
3. Propose improvement: "We can use a hash map to achieve O(n) time"
4. Discuss tradeoff: "This increases space to O(n) but significantly improves time"

### Edge Case Checklist
Always consider:
- Empty input (null, empty array, empty string)
- Single element
- All elements same
- Negative numbers (if applicable)
- Very large inputs (integer overflow)
- Duplicate elements

### Communication Best Practices
- Think aloud during problem solving
- Ask clarifying questions before coding
- Explain your approach before implementing
- Test with examples after coding
- Discuss alternative approaches

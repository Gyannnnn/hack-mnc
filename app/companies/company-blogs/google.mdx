##  Google LeetCode Questions Sorted by Acceptance Rate

Acceptance rate reveals problem difficulty vs. frequency mismatch. 
Some "easy" problems have 35% acceptance while some "hard" problems have 68% acceptance.

## Why Acceptance Rate Matters for Interview Prep

**Strategic insight:** High acceptance rate (>65%) = well-defined problem with 
clear solution patterns. These are **confidence builders** for early prep.

**Low acceptance rate (< 40%)** often means:
- Tricky edge cases (not harder logic)
- Poor problem statement
- Multiple valid approaches

🎯 **Recommendation:** Start with high-acceptance problems to build momentum.

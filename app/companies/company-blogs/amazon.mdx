# Amazon Interview Questions: 300+ LeetCode Problems Asked in 2024-2025 (SDE I/II) with Frequency & Leadership Principles

Master your Amazon SDE interview with this comprehensive list of 300+ LeetCode coding questions actually asked in recent Amazon technical rounds, organized by frequency, difficulty, and topic—plus proven strategies for answering Leadership Principles behavioral questions that appear in every Amazon interview.

## Understanding Amazon's Unique Interview Process

Amazon's interview process stands apart from other tech giants through its emphasis on Leadership Principles and its rigorous bar raiser system. Unlike companies that focus solely on technical skills, Amazon evaluates every candidate against its 16 Leadership Principles throughout both technical and behavioral rounds.

The typical Amazon interview process begins with an online assessment containing 2-3 coding problems and a work simulation assessment. Successful candidates advance to phone screens with one or two technical rounds, followed by an onsite loop consisting of 4-6 interviews. Each interview combines coding questions with behavioral questions tied to specific Leadership Principles.

### The Bar Raiser Round

Amazon's bar raiser system ensures consistent hiring standards across the company. One interviewer in your loop will be a bar raiser—a specially trained employee from outside your target team who has veto power over hiring decisions. The bar raiser evaluates whether you would raise the overall talent bar of the team you're joining.

Bar raiser rounds typically include more challenging technical questions and deeper behavioral discussions. Candidates must demonstrate not just competence but excellence in problem-solving, communication, and alignment with Amazon's culture. The bar raiser looks for candidates who can succeed in ambiguous situations and drive results while maintaining high standards.

### Amazon's Leadership Principles in Technical Interviews

Every Amazon interview incorporates Leadership Principles evaluation, even during coding rounds. While solving technical problems, interviewers observe whether you demonstrate Customer Obsession by considering edge cases, show Ownership by taking responsibility for your solution's completeness, and exhibit Bias for Action by making progress even with incomplete information.

Understanding how Leadership Principles connect to coding interviews gives you a significant advantage. When you clarify requirements before coding, you demonstrate Customer Obsession. When you discuss trade-offs between solutions, you show Frugality and judgment. When you optimize your initial solution, you exemplify Insist on the Highest Standards.

**Find Median from Data Stream** tests advanced heap usage with two heaps maintaining balance. This challenging problem appears in senior-level interviews because it requires sophisticated data structure design.

## Amazon Leadership Principles and Behavioral Questions

Every Amazon interview dedicates significant time to behavioral questions based on Leadership Principles. Technical competence alone is insufficient—you must demonstrate cultural fit through concrete examples from your experience.

### Customer Obsession

Amazon's most important principle emphasizes starting with the customer and working backward. Interviewers ask questions like "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer" or "Describe a situation where you had to balance customer needs with technical constraints."

Strong answers provide specific examples showing how you prioritized customer experience, gathered customer feedback, or made decisions that benefited customers even when difficult. In technical interviews, demonstrate Customer Obsession by discussing how your code handles edge cases that real users might encounter.

### Ownership

Ownership means acting on behalf of the entire company beyond your specific team. Interviewers ask "Tell me about a time you took on something outside your area of responsibility" or "Describe a project where you had to drive results without direct authority."

Effective responses show initiative, long-term thinking, and willingness to handle unpleasant tasks. In coding rounds, demonstrate Ownership by thoroughly testing your solution and discussing production considerations like logging, monitoring, and error handling.

### Invent and Simplify

Amazon values innovation and simplification over complexity. Questions include "Tell me about a time you simplified a complex process" or "Describe an innovative solution you created."

Strong answers show creativity in problem-solving and ability to reduce complexity. During technical interviews, demonstrate this principle by starting with simple solutions and only adding complexity when necessary, explaining why simpler approaches won't work.

### Bias for Action

Amazon expects employees to act quickly in uncertain situations rather than waiting for perfect information. Interviewers ask "Tell me about a time you had to make a decision without complete information" or "Describe a situation where speed mattered."

Effective responses show calculated risk-taking and ability to iterate. In coding interviews, show Bias for Action by making progress even when you don't immediately see the optimal solution, explaining your thought process as you refine your approach.

### Earn Trust

Building trust through honesty and transparency is crucial at Amazon. Questions include "Tell me about a time you had to deliver bad news" or "Describe a situation where you admitted a mistake."

Strong answers demonstrate vulnerability, accountability, and focus on solutions over blame. During technical rounds, earn trust by admitting when you don't know something rather than bluffing, and by honestly assessing your solution's limitations.

## Preparing for Amazon Coding Interviews

Successful Amazon interview preparation requires balancing technical skill development with Leadership Principles preparation. Most candidates need 2-4 months of focused preparation depending on their current skill level and interview experience.

### Building Your Study Plan

Start with assessment and goal setting. Take a diagnostic test with 5-10 medium LeetCode problems to gauge your current level. If you solve fewer than half optimally, begin with fundamentals. If you solve most but slowly, focus on speed and pattern recognition.

Dedicate the first 2-3 weeks to easy problems covering arrays, strings, hash maps, and linked lists. Solve 40-60 easy problems until you can write clean solutions quickly without errors. This foundation is crucial for Amazon's coding assessments.

Spend 6-8 weeks on medium problems, which form the majority of Amazon interviews. Focus heavily on dynamic programming, sliding window, two pointers, and tree problems. Aim to solve 150-200 medium problems with emphasis on Amazon-tagged questions.

Allocate 2-3 weeks to hard problems and mock interviews. Practice 30-50 hard problems focusing on those frequently asked at Amazon. Conduct weekly mock interviews to build comfort with interview pressure and communication requirements.

### Topic Prioritization for Amazon

**Dynamic Programming** deserves 25-30% of your study time. Amazon asks DP questions more frequently than most companies, so this investment pays significant dividends. Practice both 1D and 2D DP problems, focusing on identifying optimal substructure and building recurrence relations.

**Arrays and Strings** should comprise 20-25% of your preparation. Master sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums, and hash map techniques thoroughly. These patterns appear across difficulty levels at Amazon.

**Trees and Graphs** warrant 20-25% of study time. Practice all traversal types, understand when to use BFS versus DFS, and become comfortable with both recursive and iterative implementations.

**Design and Implementation** problems deserve 15-20% of your time, particularly for SDE II roles. Practice designing data structures like LRU cache, hash maps, and specialized structures that combine multiple components.

**Remaining Topics** (heaps, stacks, bit manipulation, math) should fill the final 10-15% of your preparation. While important, these appear less frequently in Amazon interviews.

### Leadership Principles Preparation

Prepare 2-3 detailed stories for each of the 16 Leadership Principles before your interview. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure responses with specific metrics and outcomes.

Choose stories that show progression, learning from failure, and impact. Amazon values candidates who made mistakes, learned, and improved over those claiming perfect track records. Be prepared to discuss what you would do differently and what you learned.

Practice articulating your stories concisely in 2-3 minutes while including enough detail to demonstrate depth. Interviewers often probe deeper with follow-up questions, so know your stories thoroughly.

## Mock Interviews and Practice Strategies

Mock interviews are essential for Amazon preparation because they simulate the pressure of real interviews and reveal gaps in your preparation. Conduct at least 6-10 mock interviews before your actual Amazon interview.

### Technical Mock Interviews

Use platforms like Pramp, interviewing.io, or professional services like InterviewQuery for realistic technical mock interviews. Practice solving problems while explaining your thought process out loud—this skill is critical for Amazon interviews but feels unnatural initially.

Time yourself strictly during practice. Amazon technical interviews typically allocate 35-40 minutes for coding with remaining time for behavioral questions. Practice solving medium problems in 25-30 minutes including testing and optimization discussion.

Record yourself solving problems or have peers observe to identify communication weaknesses. Common issues include going silent while coding, failing to explain assumptions, and rushing without clarifying requirements.

### Behavioral Mock Interviews

Practice Leadership Principles questions with friends, mentors, or career coaches who can provide feedback on your story structure and delivery. Many candidates underestimate behavioral preparation despite it being equally important to technical skills.

Time your responses to ensure conciseness. Spending 5-7 minutes on a single behavioral question leaves insufficient time for technical problem-solving. Practice delivering impactful stories in 2-3 minutes.

Prepare for follow-up questions by thinking deeply about your experiences. Amazon interviewers probe for authenticity by asking about specific decisions, alternatives you considered, and what you learned. Surface-level or memorized responses are easily identified.

## Amazon Interview Day Strategies

### Technical Round Strategies

Begin each problem by clarifying requirements thoroughly. Amazon interviewers appreciate candidates who ask thoughtful questions about input constraints, expected output format, and edge cases. This demonstrates Customer Obsession and attention to detail.

Explain your approach before coding. Spend 3-5 minutes discussing your solution strategy, analyzing complexity, and getting interviewer feedback. This prevents wasted time implementing solutions that won't meet requirements.

Write clean, production-quality code. Use meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and logical organization. Amazon evaluates code quality seriously—sloppy code suggests poor engineering practices.

Test your solution systematically. Walk through your code with example inputs, discussing your thought process. Proactively identify edge cases and explain how your solution handles them. This demonstrates thoroughness and professionalism.

Optimize when appropriate but don't over-optimize. If your interviewer seems satisfied with your current solution, ask whether they want you to optimize further rather than spending time on unnecessary improvements.

### Behavioral Round Strategies

Listen carefully to questions and identify which Leadership Principle(s) they target. Tailor your story selection to demonstrate the specific principles the interviewer wants to explore.

Use the STAR method consistently but naturally. Don't recite a memorized script—engage in genuine conversation about your experiences while ensuring you cover situation, task, action, and result.

Include metrics and specific outcomes when possible. Amazon is data-driven and appreciates quantifiable impact. Saying you "improved performance by 40%" is more compelling than "made things faster."

Be honest about mistakes and lessons learned. Amazon values growth mindset and learning from failure over flawless track records. Authentic vulnerability builds trust with interviewers.

Connect your stories to the role you're applying for when relevant. Show how your past experiences prepare you for challenges you'll face at Amazon.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid in Amazon Interviews

### Technical Mistakes

Starting to code immediately without discussing your approach wastes time and often leads to suboptimal solutions. Amazon interviewers expect structured problem-solving that begins with clarification, proceeds through approach discussion, and only then moves to implementation.

Writing messy or unorganized code suggests poor software engineering practices. Even under pressure, maintain clean code with good variable names and logical structure. Interviewers evaluate whether they would want to maintain code you write.

Failing to test your solution thoroughly indicates lack of attention to quality. Amazon expects candidates to proactively identify test cases including edge cases and explain how their code handles them correctly.

Getting stuck and going silent frustrates interviewers who want to help but can't follow your thinking. Think aloud continuously, even when uncertain. Explaining your thought process allows interviewers to provide useful hints.

Ignoring hints or feedback demonstrates poor collaboration. Amazon values candidates who incorporate feedback well. When your interviewer suggests reconsidering your approach, take their hint seriously.

### Behavioral Mistakes

Providing vague or generic stories without specific details makes it impossible to evaluate your actual experience. Amazon's interviewers are trained to identify fabricated or superficial responses through probing questions.

Taking excessive time on behavioral responses leaves insufficient time for technical problems. Keep responses concise and focused, trusting that interviewers will ask follow-up questions if they want more detail.

Failing to demonstrate multiple Leadership Principles limits your evaluation range. Amazon looks for well-rounded candidates who exhibit many principles across their experience portfolio.

Being defensive about mistakes or failures suggests lack of ownership and learning mindset. Amazon expects honest discussion of shortcomings and what you learned from them.

Neglecting to prepare questions for your interviewer wastes an opportunity to demonstrate genuine interest in Amazon and gather valuable information about the role.

## Real Amazon Interview Experiences and Success Stories

Learning from others' experiences provides valuable insights into what actually happens in Amazon interviews and how to succeed.

### Successful Candidate Experiences

Many successful candidates report that practicing Amazon-tagged LeetCode problems extensively prepared them well for actual interview questions. The most common success factor cited is recognizing familiar problem patterns during interviews.

Candidates who receive offers consistently emphasize the importance of Leadership Principles preparation. Several mention that strong behavioral responses compensated for moderate technical performance, while others report excellent technical performance wasn't sufficient without good behavioral answers.

Time management appears critical in success stories. Candidates who practiced solving problems within strict time limits performed better under interview pressure than those who focused only on solution correctness without time constraints.

### Learning from Unsuccessful Attempts

Candidates who didn't receive offers often cite insufficient preparation time as a primary factor. Many attempted interviews after 3-4 weeks of preparation when 2-3 months would have been more appropriate.

Poor behavioral preparation is another common theme in rejection experiences. Some candidates focused exclusively on technical preparation and struggled with Leadership Principles questions during interviews.

Several unsuccessful candidates mention getting stuck on problems and going silent instead of communicating their thought process. Amazon interviewers can't provide helpful hints when they don't understand your thinking.

Others report receiving offers after second attempts, attributing improvement to better time management, clearer communication, and more authentic Leadership Principles stories based on genuine self-reflection.

## Advanced Tips for Competitive Candidates

### Demonstrating Senior-Level Thinking

Even junior candidates can demonstrate advanced thinking by discussing scalability, maintainability, and production considerations beyond basic correctness.

When solving problems, mention how your solution would scale to very large inputs, how you would monitor it in production, and what failure modes might exist. This shows maturity that distinguishes strong candidates.

Discuss testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases. Mentioning how you would validate correctness in a real codebase demonstrates professional software engineering practices.

### Standing Out Through Communication

Exceptional communication differentiates good candidates from great ones. Explain not just what you're doing but why you're making specific choices.

When multiple approaches exist, compare them explicitly discussing trade-offs. This shows depth of understanding and good engineering judgment.
